to formally specify a mathematical function, 
you need to provide the domain and the codomain
as well as the formula to use

similaly, in C++ function
gives the name of the function 
describes the type of data it can be applied to 
the type of data it returns
specifies the actual formulate needed for the function.

recursion
library

declare first, and  define later. functions

put all your function declarations before the first definition, 
declare the most interesting functions first, so that someone reading your file can quickly understand the intention of the code.

??? Resist the urge to try and reorder functions so that the code compiles without the need for separate declarations.


default value of a parameter of a function
overloading functions: same function name, but take different numbers or types of parameters, order does not matter, 
the identify of a function is determined by both its name and the types of parameters,
this combination is called the signature of the function.

global and local variables
the scope of a variable refers to the parts of code where that variable can be used.
in C++ the curly brackets determine the scope of a variable. 

avoid global variables other than constants
when writing programs you should try to divide things into small independent pieces
using global variables prevents these pieces being truly independent.

multi-threaded code: code execute more than one function simultaneously.
If you use global variables in multi-threaded code you can have a situation where two
bits of code are trying to change the same variables at the same time. This is
called a race condition. To prevent this happening, you need to use a technique
called locking.
