c++ is statically typed language, 
that is you must specify the type of a data that will be stored in that variable, 
and you can't change its type.

memory terminology
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++
binary digit
8 bit = 1 byte
1024 bytes = 1 kilobyte (2^10)
1048576 bytes = 1 megabyte ( 2^20 )

use hexidecimal numbers to represent memory location
hexidecimal : base 16 
one hexidecimal digit is called a nibble.

basic data types{
	integers : when you divide two integers in c++, it rounds down if necessary.
	{
		[unsigned] {short, int, long, long long}, size_t 
	}
	floating point numbers
	{
		float, double, long double,
	}
	boolean
	characters
	{
		ASCII maps hexidecimal character codes to visible character codes
		char takes up exactly one byte. 
	}

	pointer: memory address
	{
		pointers are only an appropriate tool for solving problems involving direct memory access
		a memory address is stored in C or C++ using a pointer data type.
		a pointer to a memory location containing a 'type'

		in c++ , use
		#include<string>
		using namespace std;
		string speech = "To be or not to be?";

		instead of 
		const char* speech = "string";

		for storing text
		string is not a basic data type
	}

	casting 
	{
		convert between one data type and another.
		casting might result in a significant loss of information 
		c style cast: (type)var/val/exp
		c++ style cast : 	static_cast<type> var/val/exp
							const_cast<type>
							dynamic_cast<type>
							reinterpret_cast<type>
	}
	fix any warnings, always treat warnings as errors.

operators
{
	sizeof
	{
		get the size (in bytes) of a data type
	}
	mathematical operations
	{
		#include<cmath>
	}
	comparison operators
	logical operators
	bitwise operators
	{
		~ bit inversion
		<< left shift
		>> right shift
		| bitwise or
		& bitwise and
		^ bitwise xor
	}
	assignment operator
}
